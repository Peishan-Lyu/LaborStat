Some statements on demographics are very well known, such as: Europe, Russia and Japan have been suffering low birth rate and aging population problems which may impede their prosperity in the coming decades. Some forecasts are surprising, such as the one shown in class (“Spatial Data” section): By 2100, Africa’s population will overtake Asia which used to be home of 2/3 of world population just two centuries ago. Some recent developments are eyecatching, such as: world population reached 8 billion in 2022, and that India’s population is set to surpass China’s in 2023. In this project, we aim to achieve two goals, in a visualization approach: 1. Highlight the current situation of world demographics, and the historical trends of the past decades, by region and country. 2. Look for patterns and relationships, both among demographic factors, and between demographic factors and other indicators (e.g. economic, educational, medical). "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability 2.3 Plots plan", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic The first objective of this project is to highlight the current situation and historical trends. This shows us where we are, and where we have come from. These are the aspects we want to present: How have the world and regional populations evolved over the past 5 decades? Which regions have the youngest / oldest population? Which regions have had the highest / lowest birth rate, death rate, and population growth? How have birth rates changed cross-sectionally by country? How has world longevity evolved over the past decades? Is there any gender asymmetry in the birth rate and longevity? The second objective of this project is to look for patterns and relationships among demographic and other factors. Hopefully this can reveal some hidden and intrinsic logics, and provide us with more profound understandings of world demographics. These are the questions we want to answer via visualization: How do other demographic factors affect birth rate? How do non-demographic factors (economic, healthcare, and education) affect birth rate? How does income category affect longevity? How does income category affect death rates of difference causes? How do labor force and quality affect economic development? 2.2 Data availability To answer the questions in the previous section, we need periodic data in various demographic and non-demographic statistics, broken down into regions and countries. The data should cover fields such as: * Demographic: population by gender and age group, birth rate, death rate, life expectancy * Economic: gdp per capita, income per capita, economic growth * Social: education, medical services * Policies: A reliable data source that serves our purposes is the World Bank’s database “Health Nutrition and Population Statistics” (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics). They maintain comprehensive demographic and non-demographic data covering the aspects mentioned above. The data can be downloaded as spreadsheet from the interface, by specifying filters on country, series (field), and year. Data can be imported to RStudio from the spreadsheet. 2.3 Plots plan Current situation and historical trends 1 How have the world and regional populations evolved over the past 5 decades?

Different data fields are supplied by different entities: * Demographic data fields are mostly collected by United Nations Population Division. * Economic data fields are mostly collected by World Bank. * Educational data fields are mostly by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. * Medical data fields are mostly by WHO. Despite the diverse nature of the data fields, they all fit into a similar framework: one observation per year per country / region / country group. Frequency of updates: The update is probably on an ad-hoc basis, as difference sources run different schedules. (One evidence of update being ad-hoc is: 2021 data is now available for some fields but not for others, and each available field is available for all the countries.) As stated in earlier sections, demographics changes slowly, and it usually takes effect over a long horizon. Therefore, the time-sensitiveness of data is not a big issue for our study. Data Format: The data query filters on “country”, “series” (field), and “year”. The downloaded data (from each query) is in the format of a single big table in spreadsheet. The rows are the Cartesian product of the countries and fields, and the columns are the years. In total there are 266 “country” (country / region / country group), 443 “series” (field), and 50 “year”. Options: We decide to query all the 443 data “series” (field), despite that most of them will not be used in the project. This is for reproducibility, because we avoid choosing the fields manually. The total data size is ~40 MB which is reasonable. The “country” filter contains not only countries, but also regions (e.g. North America, Middle East, Euro Area) and income categories (e.g. Upper Middle Income, Least Developed). We choose to make three separate queries and download three separate spreadsheet files, because these three types of classification are not consistent with each other, and cannot be blended. The regions are not mutually exclusive. Besides the collection of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive regions (which have “Europe &amp; Central Asia”), we also include “Euro Area” and “European Union”, because “Europe &amp; Central Asia” is too coarse, while “Euro Area” and “European Union” represent more specific economic / social conditions. Known Issues: Data for some small countries are not complete. We will filter only countries with population &gt; 1 million as of 2022. Data for 2021 are not complete. We will use data up to 2020. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Current situation and historical trends 4.2 Pattern and relationships", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Current situation and historical trends Question 1: How have the world and regional populations evolved over the past 5 decades?
