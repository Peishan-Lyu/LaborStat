# Proposal

## Research topic

The first objective of this project is to highlight the current situation and historical trends. This shows us where we are, and where we have come from. These are the aspects we want to present:
* How have the populations of different regions evolved over the past 5 decades?
* Which regions / countries have the youngest / oldest population?
* Which regions / countries have had the highest / lowest population growth?
* Which regions / countries have the highest / lowest birth and death rates?
* Which countries have the best / worst longevity? Which countries had the biggest improvement / deterioration in longevity?
* Is there any gender asymmetry in the demographic structure?

The second objective of this project is to look for patterns and relationships among demographic and other factors. Hopefully this can reveal some hidden and intrinsic logics, and provide us with more profound understandings of world demographics. These are the questions we want to answer via visualization:
* How do other demographic factors affect birth rate and population?
* How do non-demographic factors (economic conditions, social factors, and policies) affect birth rate?
* How do non-demographic factors affect death rates of difference causes?
* How do non-demographic factors affect longevity?
* How do non-demographic factors affect migration?
* How do labor force and education affect the economic development?


## Data availability

To answer the questions in the previous section, we need periodic data in various demographic and non-demographic statistics, broken down into regions and countries. The data should cover fields such as:
* Demographic: population by gender and age group, birth rate, death rate, life expectancy
* Economic: gdp per capita, income per capita, economic growth
* Social: education, medical services
* Policies:

A reliable data source that serves our purposes is the World Bank’s database “Health Nutrition and Population Statistics” (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics). They maintain comprehensive demographic and non-demographic data covering the aspects mentioned above.

The data can be downloaded as spreadsheet from the interface, by specifying filters on country, series (field), and year. Data can be imported to RStudio from the spreadsheet.
