The past few years have witnessed perhaps the most dramatic swings in some of the key macroeconomic readings of the United States.

In 2019, unemployment rate reached multi-decade low at ~3.6% percent, after a long and steady downward ride from the ~10% level seen in the last Financial Crisis. The trend was then abruptly reversed due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which led to massive shut-downs and unemployment rate skyrocketing to 13%, the highest level in record. More dramatically, the transient peak in unemployment rate was quickly resolved, largely thankful to the Federal Reserve’s large-scale quantitative easing. As of recent, the U.S. nationwide unemployment rate is at 3.57%, another multi-decade low, below the pre-pandemic levels.

Despite the “full employment”, the U.S. economy still faces challenges. Runaway inflation is frequently appearing in the news headlines, despite the Federal Reserve reversing course. Salaries have also had rapid raises. These combined together are affecting everyone’s life and thoughts.

For people who follow the economy closely, all of the above may sound very familiar, but this phenomenal time period deserves a closer inspection that adds insights from more aspects in addition to the general trend. We are interested in these questions below:

* Which sectors had the sharpest increase in unemployment rate during early-pandemic, and which ones were shielded from the impact?
* Which sectors had the quickest recovery, and which sectors lagged behind?
* Were there demographic (age, sex, race) disparities in pandemic-caused unemployment?
* How was labor force participation rate affected?
* Which people switch from full-time jobs to part-time jobs during the pandemic?
* Which sectors enjoyed the biggest wage raises during the high inflation period, and which sectors were stagnant?
* Were there demographic (age, sex, race) disparities in wage raises during the high inflation period?
